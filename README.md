Features: 
    This projects highlights the use of C.R.U.D. (Create, Read, Update, Delete), although in this instance we do not Delete the users or their information. We use authentication to limit what pages can be navigated to until the user is Created/Logged in. This app could be tailored to work with other applications that need to add or remove from stock while keeping track of which employee that was logged in.
